# Street Sign Classifier
Altin Rexhepaj, 2018

## About
The goal of this program is to classify images of street signs using a computer vision approach. In particular, I make use of edge detection, image rectification, contour approximation, and template matching.

## How to run
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python classify.py`
3. Check `classifed/` for the labelled street signs
